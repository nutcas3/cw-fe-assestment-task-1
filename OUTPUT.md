# Changes Made

## Code Structure Improvements

1. Modular Architecture
   - Issue: All components were in a single App.tsx file
   - Fix: Created organized directory structure:
     ```
     src/
     ├── components/
     │   ├── ui/          (existing UI components)
     │   └── features/    (new feature components)
     │       ├── Header.tsx
     │       ├── HeroSearch.tsx
     │       ├── SearchInput.tsx
     │       └── TagList.tsx
     └── pages/
         └── Home.tsx
     ```
